# Breast-Cancer-Prediciton

Breast cancer affects the majority of women worldwide, and it is the second most common cause of death among women. However, if cancer is detected early and treated properly, it is possible to be cured of the condition. Early detection of breast cancer can dramatically improve the prognosis and chances of survival by allowing patients to receive timely clinical therapy. Furthermore, precise benign tumour classification can help patients avoid unneeded treatment. In this project, we explore machine learning models that can be applied to help increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis of breast cancer. Futher we have visualised using different diagrams in R.

### [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) <br>

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
